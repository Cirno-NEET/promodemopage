    <h1 class="specialUnderline">Graduating from Miskatonic University: A Tribute to H.P. Lovecraft</h1>
    <h2>"That is not dead which can eternal lie / And with strange aeons even death may die."</h2>

    <p href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._P._Lovecraft" class="specialUnderline">Who is H.P. Lovecraft?</p>
    <h2>Howard Phillips Lovecraft, better known by his pen name H.P. Lovecraft, was an American horror fiction writer best known for his role as progenitor of the Cthulhu Mythos. He has been called the "father of cosmic horror," as his work was the impetus for that genre's proliferation. His literary style is based around the idea of cosmicism, which claimed that humanity was an insignificant part of an uncaring and fragile universe that could be swept away at any moment. To support this point, his stories included fantastic and science fiction elements that represented the perceived fragility of anthropocentrism; the bulk of his stories take place in a fictionalized version of New England. Civilizational decline also plays a major role in his works, as he believed that the West was in decline during his lifetime.</h2>
    <h2>Lovecraft's stories evoke a sense of dread and inevitability in the reader that few other writers can match. His brand of horror is wholly unique and, frankly, has yet to be truly replicated in the world of fiction. Lovecraft himself had a highly troubled personal life, which may have lent itself to his highly fatalistic literary point of view.</h2>
    <h2>TL;DR: He's a complete maniac, but damn, is he ever good at writing.</h2>

    <p href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cthulhu_Mythos" class="specialUnderline">About the Cthulhu Mythos</p>
    <h2>This is the mythos created by H.P. Lovecraft and the crux of many of his literary works. It focuses on a humanity that is unaware of a higher power in the universe: a collective of "Great Old Ones", elder deities that onced ruled over the Earth but have since fallen dormant. The sweeping majority of his stories involve themes of madness and seeing that which is not meant to be seen, and a lot of the main characters of his books tend to be one-offs––that is to say, they're dead by the end of it. An especially notable thing that Lovecraft does in his writing is intentional nebulousness––he never describes the "monster" in detail. In doing so, he takes advantage of our imagination, leaving plenty of empty spaces and allowing the reader to fill in the blanks themselves.</h2>
    <h2>TL;DR: The universe is a house of cards, and it's sitting next to an oscillating fan.</h2>

    <p class="specialUnderline">Lovecraft's Dark Trinity</p>
    <h2>Lovecraft’s so-called “Dark Trinity” — Azathoth, Nyarlathotep, and Yog-Sothoth — are inverse analogues to the Holy Trinity in Christian dogma. They represent the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, respectively. A lot of the lore surrounding the Cthulhu Mythos centers around them. One might notice that this trinity does not contain Cthulhu, for whom the mythos is named: this is because Cthulhu is, all things considered, not a major player in the Lovecraft saga, despite being its namesake. It... He? They? What are Cthulhu's pronouns?...is simply the most popular and well-known of his "monsters."</h2>
    <h2>What I'm saying here is, Cthulhu ain't shit. Here's why.</h2>

    <p class="specialUnderline">Azathoth</p>
    <h2>Azathoth has literally no set description, as do most Outer Gods, but most people think of it as a "space flower" made of mouths and tentacles, because we're all about that weird shit here. Azathoth is situated at the center of the universe, and he's in a constant state of naptime. His worshippers are unique in that they're trying NOT to wake him up, because if he ever does wake up, his dream stops existing, and by extent, so does literally everything. Azathoth is also the progenitor of every other Old One in the mythos, including the other two members of the Dark Trinity. He represents the inverse of "the Father"––being one that governs the state of existence itself.</h2>
    <h2>TL;DR: He's a giant space tumor that REALLY needs to stay asleep.</h2>

    <p class="specialUnderline">Nyarlathotep</p>
    <h2>Nyarlathotep is essentially the messenger of the Old Ones. He (and it is actually specifically a "he") differs from the other deities in the Mythos in a number of ways. Most of the Outer Gods are exiled to the stars, like Yog-Sothoth and Azathoth, and most of the Great Old Ones are sleeping and dreaming like Cthulhu; Nyarlathotep, however, is active and frequently walks the Earth in the guise of a human being, usually a tall, slim, joyous man. He has "a thousand" other forms and manifestations, most of them rather difficult to look at. Much like Azathoth represents "the Father," Nyarlathotep represents the inverse of "the Son"––makes sense, considering Nyarlathotep is Azathoth's spawn. Ergo, as the Christ analogue, Nyarlathotep takes a human form and interacts with humanity.</h2>
    <h2>TL;DR: The tentacle monster needs to mind his goddamn business.</h2>

    <p class="specialUnderline">Yog-Sothoth</p>
    <h2>Like many Lovecraftian gods, Yog-Sothoth has many different appearances throughout the various stories of the mythos, by various authors. However, there seems to be a common agreement that Yog-Sothoth visually manifests as a mass of glowing orbs, with eyes or tendrils in some versions, and in others simply the orbs. It is heavily implied, if not outright stated, that Yog-Sothoth is omniscient, and is locked outside the universe, meaning he can know and see all of space-time all at once, which means there is no secret hidden from Yog-Sothoth. Yog-Sothoth represents the inverse of the "Holy Spirit"––as an invisible, yet omnipresent and omniscient force from which nothing can be hidden.</h2>
    <h2>TL;DR: He's like Santa Claus, but...actually, no, he's exactly like Santa Claus.</h2>

    <p class="specialUnderline">In Short: Read Lovecraft.</p>
